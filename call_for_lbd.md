# Call for Late-Breaking/Demo Contributions

Prototype systems, initial concepts, and early results which have not yet fully matured but are of interest to the Music-IR community may be submitted to the Late-Breaking/Demo (LBD) session.

Those interested should submit extended abstracts (2 pages maximum, two columns each, see new template below) through the submission system. Said abstracts will go through a light review, and those accepted must be presented as posters during the LBD session on the last day of ISMIR 2020. Please note that extended abstract is not a conference paper. Therefore, it will not be part of the official ISMIR 2020 proceedings, and should not be cited as such.

The LBD session has a maximum capacity of 50 posters. Submissions will be reviewed on a first come first served basis. Thus, submission will close by the dates mentioned below or by reaching full capacity, whichever comes first.

Each paper will be presented during the conference via a digital poster during two short poster sessions of 1 hour scheduled 12 hours apart. As much as possible, the live video-chat poster session times will be selected to fit normal waking hours in the presenting author’s time zone. Under extenuating circumstances (child care constraints, etc.) an author may choose to only present once, but we strongly encourage everyone to take the opportunity to have their work shared with all ISMIR attendees.

## Important Dates

## Submission Guidelines

* A submission should be an extended abstract describing a preliminary result, idea, application, or a demo of a new product or technology of interest to the Music-IR community.
* Submissions should be one page (preferred) or two pages (maximum) of content including bibliography.
* All LBD extended abstracts are required to be presented by one of the authors as a poster (and optionally a demo) on the last day of ISMIR 2020 (October 15th). Posters must use portrait orientation and be no larger than A0 or 36 x 48 inch, but they don’t need to be printed.
* Submission will be open until 11:59 pm AoE on September 22nd, 2020. 
* Submissions should not be anonymised.
* All submissions will undergo a light peer review. If the paper does not follow the guidelines, it will be sent back to the authors through a "Request for revision".
* Make sure to use the latest templates (available for [LaTeX and Word](https://github.com/ismir/paper_templates/releases)). Submissions must be in PDF format. If you’re using Word, save the Word document as a PDF. If you’re using LaTeX, you should have a PDF already.
* Authors are encouraged to submit their poster with their initial submission of extended abstract.
* Authors can submit as supplementary material an optional demo video of 5 minutes or less, mp4 format, h264 codec, 100 MB or less, with closed captions in case of voice-over.
* The submission system is the same as the one used for the main proceedings: [Microsoft CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ISMIR2020/Submission/Index).
